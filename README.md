🎓 Smart Scholarship Allocation OptimizerMaximizing Impact and Equity through Linear ProgrammingThis project implements a constraint-based optimization engine to solve the Resource Allocation Problem in higher education. Using Linear Programming (PuLP) and Pandas, it automatically matches students to scholarships to maximize total utility while strictly enforcing budget caps, eligibility rules, and diversity quotas.🚀 Why This Matters?Scholarship administration is often manual, slow, and prone to bias. This script demonstrates how Operations Research can be applied to:Guarantee Fairness: Enforce hard constraints (e.g., minimum 40% of funds to low-income applicants).Maximize Efficiency: Ensure every dollar is spent where it generates the highest "match value."Prevent Fraud/Errors: Automatically handle complex rules like "Max 1 award per student" or major-specific requirements.🛠️ Tech StackPython 3.9+Pandas & NumPy: For high-performance data manipulation and vectorization.PuLP: An optimization framework used to model and solve the Linear Programming problem.CBC Solver: The default open-source solver used by PuLP to find the optimal solution.⚙️ How It WorksThe system operates in three distinct phases:1. Data Engineering & Search Space CreationGenerates a synthetic dataset of 200 students (GPA, SAT, Income, Major) and 5 scholarship funds.Performs Min-Max Normalization on GPA and Test Scores to create a standardized "Merit Score" (0.0 - 1.0).Uses a Cartesian Product (Cross Join) to generate every possible Student-Scholarship combination (~1,000 potential edges).2. The "Match Value" AlgorithmCalculates a utility score for every valid pair based on weighted priorities:$$\text{Value} = \text{Amount} \times (w_{need} \cdot \text{NeedScore} + w_{merit} \cdot \text{MeritScore})$$This ensures that need-based scholarships prioritize low-income students, while merit-based awards prioritize high achievers.3. Linear Optimization (The Engine)The problem is modeled as a Binary Integer Programming problem:Objective: Maximize total Match Value.Constraint 1: Total awards cannot exceed scholarship capacity.Constraint 2: A student cannot receive more than 1 scholarship.Constraint 3 (Equity): At least 40% of awards must go to low-income applicants.📦 Installation & UsageClone the repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/scholarship-optimizer.git
cd scholarship-optimizer
Install dependencies:Bashpip install pandas numpy pulp
Run the script:Bashpython main.py
📊 Sample OutputThe script outputs a summary of the allocation, proving that constraints were met:PlaintextStatus: Optimal
Total awards allocated: 66
Low-income share of winners: 0.758 (Constraint Met > 0.4)

Scholarship Usage Summary:
- SCH_CS (CS Innovators): 8/8 awarded, Avg GPA: 3.54
- SCH_NEED_1 (Access Grant): 15/15 awarded, 100% to low-income students
🔮 Future ImprovementsIf deployed in a production environment, I would enhance the system with:Soft Constraints: Implementing penalty terms for the diversity quota so the solver doesn't fail (return "Infeasible") if the applicant pool is too small to meet the strict 40% target.Shadow Pricing: Extracting dual values from the solver to explain why a specific student was rejected (e.g., "Student X would have won if GPA was 0.05 points higher").Vectorized Filtering: Replacing the .apply() row-based logic with direct Pandas vector operations for scalability on datasets >1M rows.
